# Morse-Code-Decode
Morse Code is a project that enables users to decode Morse code messages into readable text. The tool is built using the Ruby programming language and takes Morse code input in the form of dots, dashes, and spaces. The program then converts the input into the corresponding ASCII characters and outputs the decoded message.
